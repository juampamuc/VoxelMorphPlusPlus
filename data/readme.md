The exhale lung CT scans are resampled to 1.75 x 1.25 x 1.75 mm, the inspiration ones to 1.75 x 1.00 x 1.25 mm. Next the volumes are cropped to a region-of-interest of size 192 x 192 x 208 that centres the lung masks. This already may half the TRE for DIR-Lab COPD as it peforms a translation + scale global transformation.
